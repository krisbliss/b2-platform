"""Context-aware death-certificate verification tool.

Registered as the ``death_certificate_verification`` agent tool. The model calls
it with no arguments once a user has sent a document; the image itself is never
seen by the model. This handler pulls the user's most recent image from the
transient session store (via the run's SessionContext), runs the full
reliability pipeline, and — when the result clears the acceptance policy — hands
the case off to GiveLight.

Flow: SessionContext → latest image → run_pipeline → (policy) → handoff.
